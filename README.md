## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables ground_clearance and vehicle_length (as well as the intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model, these variables have a significant impact on the miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The **p-value: 5.35e-11** is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis and the slope of the linear model is not zero.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This linear model has **R-squared: 0.7149**, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. This model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
